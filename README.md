Rexhall Bank ETL Pipeline

📌 Project Overview

Rexhall Bank is enhancing its data infrastructure through a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using PySpark. This project automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage to improve operational efficiency, risk assessment, and data-driven decision-making. By using Apache Spark, the pipeline can process large volumes of financial data in a distributed environment, ensuring high performance, fault tolerance, and scalability.


🎯 Key Objectives: ✔️ Automate Data Extraction. ✔️ Enable Distributed Processing using PySpark for handling large datasets efficiently. ✔️ Improve Data Quality & Consistency through transformations, deduplication, and validation. ✔️ Enhance Real-Time Data Analytics


🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools: ✔️ Big Data Processing: PySpark (Apache Spark). ✔️ Programming Languages: Python, SQL. ✔️ Database Management: PostgreSQL. ✔️ Workflow Orchestration: Apache Airflow
  

🚀 ETL Pipeline Workflow

1️⃣ Data Extraction

🔹 Uses PySpark to extract large datasets (CSV).

🔹 Enables real-time data ingestion.

2️⃣ Data Transformation

🔹 Cleans and standardizes raw data, removing duplicates and handling missing values.

🔹 Applies business logic to structure financial data for analytics.

🔹 Uses Spark DataFrames for distributed processing.

3️⃣ Data Loading: Stores transformed data in PostgreSQL, ensuring optimized indexing for fast querying.


📊 Business Impact on Rexhall Bank:  ✔️ High-Performance Data Processing – Handles millions of records efficiently with PySpark. ✔️ Optimized Data Governance – Ensures compliance with financial regulations. ✔️ Faster Insights & Reporting – Reduces query execution time from hours to minutes.


📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 Integrate real-time streaming with Spark Structured Streaming and Kafka.

🔹 Optimize performance with Spark SQL & partitioning techniques.

🔹 Implement machine learning models for fraud detection.
